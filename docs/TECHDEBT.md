# Technical Debt

The following document lists the technical debt of this service.
In order to prioritize we make use of the [MoSCoW-Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method). Moreover, each category is ordered by priority descending from highest to lowest.

## Must do

> `Must do` technical debt are design changes or temporary quickfixes that must be taken care of as soon as possible. They are not breaking anything but having them in the system either creates problems right now or will do so in the near future.

---

## Should do

> `Should do` technical debt are some changes that need to be done sooner or later but don't have too much impact on the current or near future situation. Therefore, those topics should be handled sooner or later but don't need to be taken care of that fast.

---

## Could do

> `Could do` technical debt are debts that can be a great improvement for the system but doesn't overall qualify as something really needed to be done. Those are the "cherry on the cake" fixes that are only done if enough time is available.

---

## Won't do

> As the name suggests `Won't do` technical debt is something that won't be fixed. Reasons for this could be different, ranging from "too complicated" to "not enough improvements by doing so". This category's intention is to collect explanations why certain changes got rejected in order to close future discussions about the same topic sooner.
